# PH-analysis-with-R
Welcome to this new project! I am dongyao who major in Vet and Bioinformatics. 

PH is the abbreviation of pulmonary hypertension. I focus on this disease when I was a freshman in NWAFU.  

Pulmonary hypertension symptoms include:
Shortness of breath (dyspnea), initially while exercising and eventually while at rest.
Fatigue.
Dizziness or fainting spells (syncope)
Chest pressure or pain.
Swelling (edema) in your ankles, legs and eventually in your abdomen (ascites)

This project intend to give us a macroscopical genomics understandings about this disease. The main change in patient is remodeling of pulmonary vessel wall which includes the endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, etc. 

Secondly, we don't focus only one array data, we try to present different tissue sample data.
